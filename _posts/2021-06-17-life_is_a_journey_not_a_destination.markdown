Each and every one of us undertakes a series of journeys throughout our lives, We constantly have physical, intellectual, and inner journeys until the day we leave this world. These journeys are the basis of human experience in this world and are inevitable, as in every new situation a journey starts. A journey may change us, as we try to internalize the different experiences and possible decisions we could or should have made. People learn from journeys, become enlightened and outcomes can be life-changing.


Early 2020, I was visiting family in Egypt when the news of COVID-19 was just starting to spread and a few countries had started an indefinite lockdown. Returning home to a nationwide lockdown was not quite how I imagined. For me, the lockdown was a good chance to reflect, unwind, and think about effective ways to use that bit of extra time we have at home. That’s when I starteddecided to persue a passion I have always been interested in, use that gift of time to try what learn what I have always thought that I was too late to learn.


I have developed a passion for the amazing career of software engineering. I have always loved puzzles and had always thought of software engineering as playing Scrabble. Imagine that I am being paid to play word games all day long! Besides, I can create entire worlds with my set of rules, and the only practical limitations are my imagination. This is a very seductive notion for a person with tons of ideas like me. Without a shadow of a doubt, I strongly believe in the philosophy that “do what you love in your life, and you will never regret”.


I am one project away from finishing my software engineering boot camp and already starting to think about starting to look for jobs and possible companies/positions that will help me develop, evolve and advance the basic knowledge I have acquired over the last 10 months.


The first issue I will likely encounter is proving myself to other software engineers with bachelor's degrees. A challenge that I am excited to take on. For most of us, in the boot camp, this is just the beginning and it's upon us to expand our knowledge and find ourselves in a niche in the market. Soon enough, it will be time to sit back and reflect on a life-changing decision I made and how it has catapulted me into new possibilities. And then...onto a new journey...
