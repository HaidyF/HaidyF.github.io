After a year of studying at Flatiron, I have finally made it. or at least I thought so! turns out I am just half way there yet. There is still a lot of learning, work and lots of grit needed.

One thing I have learned and want to put into words to always remember to follow is project planning. A lot of times we get this amazing idea and we get too excited to start coding and thats when things start getting messy, fast! 

Having a solid, written plan saves so much time and energy. I always start by writing down the idea and putting down the steos in a simple *human* language, these I go back to when I am coding; making sure all the steps are done in order. 

I plan my models and how they will relate to eachother which adds a lot more clarity to how you want to set up the application. I always use draw.io to map out my backend relationships.

After, I create my repository and start creating my folders and their related files, followed by linking it all together on GitHub. I generate my models on the backend and set up my routes, I create my database and seed some data to it for testing purposes and then make sure all my relationships are connected correctly. 

I take a break from coding and starting designing what I want my application to look like, look up NPM packages or libraries that would help save me some time. After all that is figured out, that is when I get to code and make it all happne and come together!
