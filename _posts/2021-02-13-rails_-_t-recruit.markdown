We are more than half-way through! This journey has been one of the most difficult yet most exciting endeavors in my life. Finishing up mod 3 and working on my third project now, I find myself regularly reminding myself of how far I have gotten and patting myself on the back often for making it this far; makes me pretty proud.

For my Rails project I have built a recruitment app -T-Recruit- and it has been pretty fun building it, projects are always way more fun than labs. Before building any project I usually take a day to research, find and idea and execute a preliminary plan for how I will approach building it, associations and an idea of how I want my app to look. 

I started off building this up by generating the models, migrating them, creating the associations and adding the custom routes needed to run the app properly. Afterwards, I created the views files  along with some partials that I am going to need and then took it a step at time building the controller actions for each view file. Running the server and testing as I go helped a lot.

I then went on and created my Omniauth which gave me a good amount of trouble and took a good couple of hours to debug, I got it to work though so it was all good in my world again!  The other thing that needed a lot of debugging was building the associations between my models to have my user_id and job_id associating with all the applicaitions and comments created.

Next, I created my scope method that alphabetizes all the jobs that are created, and then reluctantly moved the methods in my application controller to my application helpers file, at this point I was not ready for anything to break.

When all was good and working, I then went ahead and played with my views a bit to make the app look a little more presentable and to make the app more user-friendly and more pleasant to use. I canâ€™t wait to get to pass my review!!!
