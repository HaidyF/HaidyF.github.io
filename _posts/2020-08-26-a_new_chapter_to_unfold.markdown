Studying software development has always been a dream of mine, but growing up in Egypt I was not blessed with the opportunity to fulfill this dream. When I moved to the US 6 years ago, I had to leave everything I have built behind and start from scratch. As scary as the idea was, but I knew that this was my chance to dive into my passions. 

At that time, I didn't know about Software Engineering boot camps or if they existed, so I went full force in my next passion which is teaching. I worked as a teacher for 2 years, an occupation that gave me so much joy but I never felt like I was fulfilling my potential with what I was teaching my students, I always felt like something was missing. I had my second daughter in 2019, went on maternity leave and then Covid-19 struck. Knowing that I won't be able to send my girls to school or daycare and that I am stuck home for another year made me wonder if I could fulfill that dream of mine and study and pursue the job I have always wanted. See challenges build who we are, give us strength and chances to grow differently. 

Studying software development gives me the chance to unify all my skills and talents to suit my potential and pursue what I love most. It is a field where I can combine my problem-solving and communication skills, use my talents to create webpages and applications and maybe one day I can merge both my passions and teach software development to my students all while securing my familyâ€™s financial stability. With a field that is so broad, that is part of every industry, the possibilities are endless.
