The idea of creating an entire project from scratch after only 7 weeks of starting the program was daunting, I didn't feel confident that I have understood enough to creat and fully executable code. I came in with so much anxiety and worry that makes completing this project a lot more special. For anyone reading this who feels the same, don't worry, you can totally do this!

The most important thing to do is watch lots and lots og project walkthroughs! the more you watch the more you know and the more confident you get. After watching the videos and getting an overarching idea of what is expected, I went ahead and read all the project requirments and before looking into available APIs. It took me about two days to find an API I felt excited to work with.

With an API picked and a priliminary plan in mind, I put all my thought into a flowchart, having a visual of the process helped a lot with knowing what should happen and in what sequence. I started by creating the skeleton of my project and then branching into more details. My initial idea was to create an app where user input a country and the app return details about the upcoming holiday in this country, but after finishing that I felt like I wanted to take the project a step further and make it a two leveled project. I modified the plan so that when users input a country's name they receive a list of all holidays this country celebrate and then they get to choose which holiday they want to get more information about. 

I t was definitely a fun project and great end to the Ruby section of this journey, looking forward to what is coming next!
